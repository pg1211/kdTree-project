# kdtree-personal-project

This repository contains an implementation of a KD-Tree (k-dimensional tree), a space-partitioning data structure used for organizing points in a k-dimensional space. KD-Trees are particularly useful for efficient nearest-neighbor searches, range queries, and multidimensional data organization.

Features
Insert Points: Add points into the KD-Tree. Insert a single point at a time
Search Points: Query if a specific point exists in the tree.
Nearest Neighbor Search (KNN): Find the k-nearest neighbors to a given point.
Delete Points: Remove points from the KD-Tree. Delete a single point at a time
